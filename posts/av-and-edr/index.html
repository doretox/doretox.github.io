Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) software are two of the many cybersecurity tools available. Despite the fact that both tools are made to guard against cyber threats, their functions and purposes are different. We will go over what EDR is in this article and how it differs from antivirus software.\nWhat is an EDR? A cybersecurity solution called endpoint detection and response (EDR) is made to find, look into, and deal with sophisticated threats on endpoints like servers, desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. The term “endpoint” describes the gadgets that are connected to a network or the internet, making them open to cyber-attacks.\nEDR enables security teams to identify and respond to sophisticated threats before they harm the network by providing real-time monitoring and analysis of endpoint activities. Additionally, it gathers and stores endpoint data, which can then be analyzed to find threat patterns and strengthen security measures.\nWhat distinguishes EDR from antivirus programs? A common cybersecurity tool that guards against known viruses and malware is antivirus (AV) software. It operates by scanning the device’s files and programs and comparing the results to a database of recognized malware signatures. If a match is found, the software will quarantine or remove the malicious file.\nAntivirus software is effective against known threats, but it may be unable to identify new and advanced threats because they frequently employ sophisticated techniques to avoid detection. The advanced threat detection capabilities offered by EDR, on the other hand, go beyond signature-based detection.\nTo identify unusual behavior on endpoints, such as unauthorized access, file modifications, and suspicious network activity, EDR employs behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms. Additionally, it offers a thorough analysis of the attack, including the attacker’s TTPs, which aids security teams in comprehending the danger and taking appropriate action.\nEDR offers incident response capabilities, whereas antivirus software does not, which is another important distinction between the two types of software. EDR enables security teams to look into and address advanced threats, including containing the threat, removing the malware, and isolating compromised endpoints.\nConclusion Despite the fact that antivirus software is a useful cybersecurity tool, it is insufficient to guard against cutting-edge and developing threats. EDR is a crucial tool for defending endpoints against current cyber threats because it offers advanced threat detection and incident response capabilities. To protect your network and devices from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, you should invest in cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions like EDR.\n","wordCount":"433","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-04-14T00:00:00+05:30","dateModified":"2023-04-14T00:00:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"doreox"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://doretox.github.io/posts/av-and-edr/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"doretox","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://doretox.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://doretox.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://doretox.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://doretox.github.io/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://doretox.github.io/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://doretox.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://doretox.github.io/>Home</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) vs Antivirus: Understanding the Differences</h1><div class=post-description>An article explaining the differences between av and edr.</div><div class=post-meta><span title="2023-04-14 00:00:00 +0530 +0530">April 14, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;doreox&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/doretox/doretox.github.io/content/posts/av-and-edr.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Cybersecurity is of utmost importance in today&rsquo;s technology-driven world, and with the increase in cyberthreats, it is now necessary to use cutting-edge tools to protect our devices and networks.

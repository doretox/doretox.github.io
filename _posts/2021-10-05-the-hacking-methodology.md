The hacking methodology is a methodical and logical process that every hacker follows to accomplish a penetration test. This ensures consistency and a pattern to be followed by the industry.

The Process that pentesters follow is:
1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration/Scanning
3. Exploitation
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Covering Tracks
6. Reporting

# Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the most important step of the process, it is a pretty simple concept. In this phase, the hacker must collect the maximum amount of useful information about the target. Information that will be useful in the next steps of hacking.

To collect this information, the hacker most of the time uses simple and very common tools as:
- Google
- Wikipedia
- Social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc)

And others not known for the public in general as:
- PeopleFinder.com
- who.is
- sublist3r
- hunter.io
This phase is called the most important of all hacking methodology because it is based on the information collected here that all next steps will be done.

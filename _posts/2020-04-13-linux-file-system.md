The Linux filesystem structure is somewhat different from that of Windows. Linux has roots in UNIX so it has the backslash for directory separation and its name system is case sensitive.
For example, on a Linux file system the following files: file.txt, File.txt and FIle.txt are different.
The Linux system is completely file-based and this makes it different from Windows systems. Let's see below how the file system is organized in Linux.

*Folders in Kali Linux.*

### /bin
Bin is an abbreviation for binaries. Here is where application binaries (the equivalent of executables in Microsoft Windows) reside. For example, LS (to list directories), cat (to show the contents of a file) and other basic functions.
 
### /sbin
Sbin means system binary. These are binaries that only the system administrator can use, and that a standard user would be able to use without permission. 
 
### /boot
This directory contains everything necessary to initialize your system. For example the Linux Kernel.

### /cdrom
There may be differences here depending on the distribution you are using. On Ubuntu-based distributions this folder is present, it is responsible for the temporary storage of CD-ROMs inserted in the system.

### /dev
The /dev directory contains the special device files for all the devices connected to your computer. For example, any device that is plugged into your computer (mouse, monitor and keyboard) will have a file created within this directory. This directory is commonly accessed by drivers.

### /etc
There are a lot of discussions about the meaning of etc, but it was confirmed by Dennis Ritchie, co-creator of Linux which means etcetera. It is in this folder all the system configurations and scripts accessed by programs, for example, the APT command.

### /home
The userâ€™s home directory. Here is stored all your personal data, files and user-specific configuration files.

### /lib, /lib32 and /lib64
In this folder are the libraries. Libraries are files that programs can use to execute functions stored in \ bin and \ sbin.

### /media
Where CDs and USB devices are usually attached or mounted to the filesystem.

### /mnt
Where other filesystems are attached or mounted to the filesystem.

### /opt
Here applications are installed manually and are not a part of the critical functioning of the system.

### /proc
Proc is where you will find files with information about processes and resources. Every process will have a file in this directory. It does not exist directly on your machine, they are created every time the machine is started.

### /root
This directory works much like / home, storing files for the ROOT user.

### /run
This folder stores various information from the period of which the machine was on, such as which user logged into the machine. Like / proc this directory is also virtual, being deleted and created again every time your computer is restarted.

### /srv
This folder is used if you are using a server. The files that will be accessed by external users are stored here for greater security.

### /sys
This directory is an interface to the kernel.

### /tmp
This is the temporary files directory. Here applications store files that will be used in the current session. 

### /usr
Here they are installed as applications used by the system user.

### /var
Here variables are stored that the system expects to increase in size over time, such as system logs.

## Conclusion
At first the file system on Linux may seem confusing, but it's just a matter of getting used to it. Most users grew up using a computer with Windows or Mac, so any system other than this ends up generating some discomfort. Over time you will find that the Linux file system is very well organized and intuitive.
